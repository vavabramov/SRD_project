# SRD_project

This code was done as a part of project on SRD subject at NOVA IMS.

The idea behind is generating of SQL query which creates and fills fresh DB with data.


-> Run **tables_generator.ipynb**  <br>
It will generate data and store it into XLSX files using Pandas.<br><br>
-> Run **sql_query_generator.ipynb** It will generate a singl SQL query which create a DB.<br>
> âš  Some minory manual fixes of SQL query are required (dtype changes, default values changes).


**sql_code_checker.ipynb** was used to check the correctness of SQL queries which were applied to the DB as tasks solutions
